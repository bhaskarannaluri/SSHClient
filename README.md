# SSHClient
SSH Client for capturing the logs

The SSHClient Tool is designed to capture the logs from multiple servers to our local desktop. 

Usage:

For capturing the logs while we are doing some operations in the UI or webservices we usually capture the logs on the fly. Sometimes it is difficult to capture logs from multiple servers as we are not sure to which server the request will go. This SSHClient tool is developed to not bother about the server to which the request is going and it will reduce our effort to capture the logs in the text file from the F-Secure. It will generate the log files in our local desktop with respect to servers.
